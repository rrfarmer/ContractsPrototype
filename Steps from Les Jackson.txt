Steps from Les Jackson on .Net Core MVC REST API Build

Get some scaffold code with:
dotnet new webapi -n ProjectName (do this inside the folder you want the project in)

Open Project in VS Code:
code -r ProjectName

Startup.cs is where a lot of config goes

Create a Models folder, this is where all data Models go

Build your starting Models

Make a Data folder, this is for your "IProjectNameRepo" interface files go
-Examples like "IEnermerable<ObjectName> GetAllObjects();" and "ObjectName GetObjectById(int id);"
